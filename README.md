## Introduction

Helmet Safety Detection is a computer vision project that uses YOLOv10 to detect whether individuals in an image are wearing helmets. This project aims to improve safety compliance in various environments such as construction sites.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Helmet-Safety-Detection.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOLOv10---Helmet-Safety-Detection
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    pip install ultralytics
    ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. **Open the `Helmet_Safety_Detection.py` file and run it.**
2. **In the terminal, execute the following command:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run Helmet_Safety_Detection.py
    ```

3. **Upload an image through the Streamlit interface, and the model will detect helmets in the image and display the results.**
